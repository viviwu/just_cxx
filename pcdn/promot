Use c or c++ posix to write A set of c/s services, and simply demonstrate the principle of pcdn service and sockets:
Basic principle: When a client (Terminal) A needs to communicate with another client B, it first queries the IP address of the target client B from the server tracker;
Then directly establish a connection with the target client B to transmit data and send messages.
Tracker(Central service): Manages and maintains all terminal information (mainly ID and IP mappings);When a terminal connects to the Tracker, the Tracker automatically records the ID and IP address of the client.
Terminal(Client application): can be connected to other terminals . Each terminal has its own ID.
Terminal provides the following command menu options for users:
1. Connect to the Tracker(ID and IP will be registered).
2. Query information about other accessible terminals(IP).
3. Connect to other known terminals;
4. Send information to other Termnal communication;
5. Send file data to other terminals.
6. Disconnect from other terminals;
7. Disconnect from the Tracker.
8. Exit.
